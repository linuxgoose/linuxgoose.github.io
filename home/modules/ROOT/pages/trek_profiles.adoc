== Episode 10: Duncan Barrett

Years ago I was given the opportunity by a lovely lad named John to practice my audio engineering skills by working on an episode of his podcast https://trekprofiles.com/[Trek Profiles].

The episode was the 10th in the podcast's existence and featured Duncan Barrett as the guest. This was a great exercise working with Adobe Audition mastering a talk show-like project.

You can list to the episode over on the Trek Profiles website https://trekprofiles.com/2018/09/13/episode-10-duncan-barrett/[here].
