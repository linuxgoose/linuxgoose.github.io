Welcome to my personal website where I experiment with technology, flex my writing muscles, and work on the occasional podcast.

As you may notice, this is not the typical personal website. My main focus at the moment is exploring the world of technical writing - which led me to my new fascination - https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] and https://antora.org/[Antora]. This site is built using both of these technologies as I explore how they can make my work easier.

If you have an interest in technical writing and would like to collaborate, discuss, or need help - send me an mailto:hello@jordanrobinson.org[email].
