= Links - What I Like & Recommend

Below are some links to things I use, like or had a hand in making.

== Software & Web Services

=== Productivity

I have gone through a lot of web services trying to find my optimal solution, but always ran into a few deal breakers. Whether that was questionable company practices, lack of certain features, pricing, or simply not enough flexibility, the below services are the ones I have been able to rely on.

* https://www.fastmail.com/[Fastmail]: Brilliant email service. Just oldschool, fast, and simple. With a sprinkle of calendars, contacts, notes, and files (even a simple website host!) using open standards.
* https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage[BackBlaze B2]: Simple object storage that allows the right amount of flexibility. Pairs nicely with https://mountainduck.io/[Mountain Duck] and https://cyberduck.io/[Cyberduck].

=== Desktop

While I use a lot of different tools throughout my day, the below are some notable hidden gems.

* https://mountainduck.io/[Mountain Duck]: Really great sync tool to get cloud sync capabilities close to Google Drive, Dropbox, etc... with https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage[BackBlaze B2].
* https://cyberduck.io/[Cyberduck]: Useful for syncing single B2 buckets to offline storage when needed.
* https://obsidian.md/[Obsidian]: Great tool to write notes in Markdown and sync with https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000277882-Remote-file-access[Fastmail Filese WebDAV] for storage or https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage[BackBlaze B2].
* https://adoc-studio.app/[adoc Studio]: While I tend to stick with https://code.visualstudio.com/[VS Code] or https://vscodium.com/[VSCodium], for those who are not developers (i.e., authors) or want some additional collaboration tools when writing in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc], adoc Studio is phenomenal.

=== Mobile

I don't really venture out much on the apps used on my phone, especially since I have gone back to using an iPhone. However, the below are some that have made using an iPhone easier.

* https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/s3-files-bucket-storage/id6447647340[S3 Files]: Used to connect to my B2 buckets. Simple and just works.

== Hardware

* https://shop.fairphone.com/nl/fairbuds[Fairbuds]: How earbuds should be. Quality audio and repairability. Less eWaste.
